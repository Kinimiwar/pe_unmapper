# pe_unmapper
Pythonic pe unmapper

Idea from https://github.com/hasherezade/pe_recovery_tools/tree/master/pe_unmapper
I just needed a simple python version

Uses pefile which can read a memory mapped PE file and then converts it from Virtual to Raw

TODO:
Add in check for section order
Add in check for already in Raw format
